This Python application turns a Raspberry Pi Pico W with a <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/presto">Presto</a> display into an intelligent calendar display that fetches and shows events from iCalendar feeds. The project demonstrates hardware integration specific to the Presto's capabilities.
What It Does
The application creates a smart calendar interface that:

Pulls events from any .ics URL (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
Displays events with intelligent categorization and color coding
Provides touch-based navigation and interaction
Shows ambient status through hardware indicators
Automatically manages power and display states

Presto-Specific Hardware Features
Dual RGB LEDs for Ambient Status
The Presto's two RGB LEDs create a sophisticated event awareness system:

Solid green: Currently in a meeting/event
Pulsing red: Event starting within 15 minutes (urgent)
Orange: Event within the next hour
Blue/purple: All-day or multi-day events
Off: No upcoming events

Touch Gesture System
The Presto's capacitive touch enables intuitive navigation:

Horizontal swipes for pagination
Pull-down gesture triggers calendar refresh with animated feedback
Upward swipe toggles between dark/light themes
Sophisticated debouncing and gesture recognition

Adaptive Backlight Control

Automatically dims after 30 seconds of inactivity
Stays bright when events are active or imminent
Instantly responds to touch interaction
Integrates with sleep mode for power savings

Screen Sleep Mode

Enters low-power state during configured hours
Implements burn-in prevention by shifting content every 3 minutes
Shows minimal "Sleep Mode" display
Instant wake on touch with full state restoration

Audio Integration

Uses the Presto's buzzer for configurable event alerts
Respects quiet hours settings
Only alerts for actionable timed events

Hardware Performance Optimizations
The application leverages the Presto's capabilities for efficiency:

Partial screen updates: Only redraws changed regions using the PicoVector library
Regional rendering: Divides screen into zones (header, pagination, events, status)
Memory-aware operation: Real-time memory monitoring and garbage collection
Network status integration: Visual feedback for WiFi connectivity

The code shows thoughtful integration with the Presto's hardware capabilities, creating an ambient information display that provides both passive awareness and active interaction. The LED system is particularly clever - it gives users instant visual feedback about their calendar status without requiring them to look directly at the screen.
This type of always-on calendar display would be useful for office environments, meeting rooms, or home offices where people need ambient awareness of their schedule combined with the ability to interact when needed.
